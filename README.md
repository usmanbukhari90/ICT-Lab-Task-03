# Assembly vs Python Reflection

## 1. Assembly Reflections
○ What did you notice about registers and instructions?
- Registers are small storage units used for quick data access and instructions are very specific.
○ How is coding in Assembly different from Python?
- Assembly requires more detailed and low-level coding than Python.

## 2. Python Reflections
○ Why is Python easier/faster for building the same project?
- Python is faster to write because it uses simpler and higher-level syntax.
○ Which features of Python help abstraction (variables, functions, loops)?
- Python supports abstraction through variables, functions, and loops.

| Feature           | Assembly Example | Python Example | Notes                              |
|------------------|------------------|----------------|------------------------------------|
| Variable storage | Register (EAX)   | x = 5          | Python handles memory automatically |
| Printing output  | INT 21h          | print()        | Python uses built-in functions     |
| Arithmetic       | ADD AX, BX       | x + y          | Python uses simple operators       |
